a chemical shift file (cchnoesy.prot) 

-- contains the assignments for the ILV methyl groups 
	in the alpha subunits of the proteasome (360 kDa alpha7-alpha7 complex).

The format is (it is xeasy):

Atom_number chemical_shift chemical_shift_error atom_name residue_number

To figure out the residue type, please have a look in the .seq file.

A peakfile of a c-c-h noe experiment (cchnoesy.peaks)
 
Here the format is:

peak_nr chem_shift1 chem_shift2 chem_shift3 2 U intensity 0.000 m 0 atom_number1 atom_number2 atom_number3 0

The experiment is recorded in such a way that atom_number3 (proton) and
atom_number1 (carbon) form the diagonal, making cross_peaks to atom_number2
(carbon). 

The intensity is just a plain maximum and should be interpreted with
care, as there might be significant peakoverlap. 
I made no attempt to quantitatively correlate intensity to distance.

Please also note the referencing of the proton shifts is off. To obtain the
chemical shift referenced to DSS one has to subtract 0.41 from the shifts in
the attached files. Sorry for that inconvenience.

The structures 
	-- 1PMA.pdb
	-- 1YAU.pdb

The structures I used are in the pdb under 1PMA.pdb and 1YAU.pdb. 
The former is the free proteasome complex at a resolution of 3.4A. 
The latter is the proteasome in complex with the 11S activator complex at 2.4A resolution.
The inaccuracy of the positions of the methyl groups in the structures becomes
obvious from the spread in methyl-methyl between the independent subunits of
the structures. Long side chains are just not very well placed in the electron
density, especially in the lower resolution structure that contains 14
independent alpha subunits.

Also note that the structure of the alpha subunits at the ring-ring interface
is different in the alpha7-alpha7 nmr sample and the alpha7-beta7-beta7-alpha7
crystal structure.
