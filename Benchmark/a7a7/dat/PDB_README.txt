In order to obtain structure model for alpha7 - alpha7 double ring

	
	1.	used information available from Sprangers, Kay Nature 2008 and from Zwickl et al. 1994. Nature Struct Mol.
	
	2.	used VMD software
	
	3.	selected chains		A C D E F G H 	>> ring1
							I J K L M N O	>> ring2
							
	4. rotated ring1 30 degrees with the respect to ring2 
	
		(according to Zwickl et al. 25 degrees rotation is seen and mimicking of the interface
		with beta subunits proposed)
			
				>> 30 degrees is justified by better alignment of structural elements of ring1
					and beta subunits
					
	5. such created structure model of alpha7alpha7 double ring is saved to 
	
				model_double_ring_Matteo.pdb
	
		and used for generating pdb graph at different distance thresholds
