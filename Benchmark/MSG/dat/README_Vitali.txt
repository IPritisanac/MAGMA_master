1. 
	the original X-ray structure of MSG has PDB ID -    1D8C
	solution NMR structure -    1Y8B, 
	NMR+SAXS refined structure -     2JQX

2.
	the file with ILV assignments of MSG is attached (ilv_ass/ilv_ass.dat)
	(if they turn out to be CHD2 instead of CH3 - just add 0.6 ppm to carbon shifts and 0.04 or so to 1H shifts.
	The methyls without stereo-assignments are labeled with A and B).
 
3.
	work with the NOE constraints only
	www.rcsb.org 1Y8B 	
	'File Download' -- used NMR constraints including Methyl-Methyl NOES. 
	Extract the comprehensive list of NOEs (it would be a good representation of the NOE spectrum)

4. 	Processed 4D NOESY data
	"I could look for the processed matrix but i am not sure i kept it in the processed form (it is about 2G and was 7 yrs. ago). 
	You can actually look in the lab --there should be some DVDs that i left with spectra --- maybe 4D NOESY is among them .... 
	Otherwise, we could try to identify the original Vladislav's script that processes the data ..."
 
 	"What you wrote about the assignment algorithm sounds very promising and intriguing..... 
	It would be also interesting to see how it performs on ALA assignments. 
	I can give 3D NOESY's of ALANINES in MSG and assignments ...... 
	There you can also rely on the secondary structure shifts....
	pls. let me know if you still need the processed 4D NOESY data ....."
