at 10A 3 subgraphs isomorphic to pdb graph
1 not >> MCES of correct solution = 54

sampling starts at 31 ... over 2 days gets to 37 ...


@10A
OBSERVED
assigned subgraphs 

1(0)
3(2) and 
4(3) 

have 0 assignment overlaps amongst themselves!

These solutions also have 0 overlap with the leftover subgraph peaks (1) ! >> run at 11 A only this subgraph restricted to its own search space?

When ran joined with restriction to their solution space from
Subgraph    N (solutions) from vf2   
    1               17408
    3               96
    4               6912

When I join these 3 components and restrict vf2 search space by labelling (according to the provided solutions)

    Subgraph    N (solutions) from vf2
    1+3+4        42467328 (?)

I do not understand this...
